(ns formatting-stack.strategies
  "Strategies are concerned with generating a seq of filenames to process (format, lint, or compile).

  Said filenames must satisfy the `::protocols.spec/filename` spec, and represent an existing file.

  They are configured to run in a determinate order.

  In practice, a strategy is function that receives a seq of filenames, and returns another:

  * more filenames may be added; and or
  * the passed filenames may be `filter`ed.

  A strategy may not return nil."
