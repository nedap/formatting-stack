(ns formatting-stack.strategies
  "Strategies are concerned with generating a seq of filenames to process (format, lint, or compile).

  They are configured to run in a determinate order.

  In practice, a strategy is function that receives a seq of filenames, and returns another:

  * more filenames may be added; and or
  * the passed filenames may be `filter`ed.

  A strategy may not return nil."

  Files such as project.clj, or .edn files, etc are not excluded, since they aren't namespaces.

  The rationale for this strategy is allowing you to create clj namespace directories that are excluded from `refresh-dirs`.
  e.g. protocol definitions,
  and then ensuring that code-evaluating tools such as refactor-nrepl or Eastwood also respect that exclusion.

  That can avoid some code-reloading issues related to duplicate `defprotocol` definitions, etc."
